# Flappy Bird with Flutter

Nelli Rossi, 2109890 <br />
Iiro Partanen, 2001269

Both contributed to the designing of the project and the initial setup. <br />
Iiro did a simple prototype of the project, that was expanded by Nelli via hand-drawn graphics and styling of elements. <br />
Nelli continued with some fixes to the physics of the bird, so the flying felt more natural. <br />
Iiro followed up with bug fixed, like on the pipes and fixing the score board to show the score correctly. <br />
Iiro also added keyboard handling for the start and end while also adding some sounds to the game. <br />
Lastly Nelli finished with score board visuals.
